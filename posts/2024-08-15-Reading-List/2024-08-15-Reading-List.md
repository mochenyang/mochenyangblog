This is a repository of articles and books that I frequently come back to. They are formative in my understanding of science and research.

- [More is Different (P.W. Anderson)](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.177.4047.393): a pure reductionist view of science is incomplete. Just because a larger entity is "made up of" smaller entities does not mean that everything there is to know about the larger entity can be derived purely from the properties of the constituent entities. More is different.
- [Strong Inference (John R. Platt)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.146.3642.347): a good theory is one that can be falsified with critical experiments.
- [50 Years of Data Science (David Donoho)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10618600.2017.1384734)
